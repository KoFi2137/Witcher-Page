        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>A witcher (Polish: wiedźmin) also known as a wiccan, hexer,vedymin, or witchman (Elder Speech: vatt'ghern),<br> is someone who has undergone extensive training, ruthless mental and physical conditioning,<br> and mysterious rituals (which take place at "witcher schools" such as Kaer Morhen)in preparation for becoming an itinerant monster slayer for hire.<br> Geralt, the central character in Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher series and the subsequent games inspired by them, is said in the stories to be one of the greatest witchers; he is certainly legendary, but whether famous or infamous is more open to interpretation (and/or subject to gameplay, as the case may be).</p><br><br><br><br>

            <h4>Geralt:</h4><p>Geralt, one of the few remaining witchers on the Continent, is a traveling monster slayer for hire, mutated and trained from an early age to slay deadly beasts. Geralt is portrayed by Michał Żebrowski in The Hexer film and TV series, while Henry Cavill portrayed the character in Netflix The Witcher series.</p>

            <h4> Ciri:</h4>
            <p>Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253,[4] and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday.[5] She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.
            After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt proclaimed the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.</p>

            <IMG SRC="img/yennefer.jpg" alt="yennefer" ALIGN="left" />
            <h4>Yennefer: </h4> <p>Yennefer of Vengerberg, born during Belleteyn in 1173,[3] was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.
            She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Supreme Council of Sorcerers within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.</p>

        <div id="vessemir">
            <IMG SRC="img/vessemir.jpg" alt="vessemir" ALIGN="left" />
            <h4>Vesemir:</h4><p>Vesemir was the oldest and most experienced witcher at Kaer Morhen in the 13th century and acted as a father figure to Geralt and the other witchers. Like many of the other witchers, he spent each winter in the fortress and set out on the path when spring arrived.
            He was one of the few members of the School of the Wolf to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. By the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; however, as he was only a fencing instructor, he didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples into witchers.[3]</p>

        <div id="triss">
            <IMG SRC="img/triss.jpg" alt="triss" ALIGN="left" />
            <h4>Triss</h4><p>Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.

            <h4>Bies:</h4><p>Fiends are four-legged mammals, possibly related to devils. Ungulates, they have antlers and three eyes. Their most dangerous weapon, in addition to the murderous charge, are hypnotic abilities - with the help of the middle eye they can blur the victim's perception so that it cannot see anything except that eye. It belongs to the group of relics.</p>

            <h4>Leszy:</h4><p>the monster inhabiting the world of The Witcher. You can find it in forests and primeval forests. He can teleport and take many forms, both humanoid and animal. Young individuals chose their location, forests and primeval forests, and then built their totems there, which they fiercely guarded.</p><br>

        <div id="sukkub">
            <IMG SRC="img/sukkub.jpg" alt="sukkub" ALIGN="right" />
            <h4>Succubus:</h4><p>A succubus (female) or incubus (male) is a creature, sometimes considered "a demon", looking like a highly attractive human being seducing real humans, first appearing in dreams from time to time, then physically, and is interested only in men that have already come of age. Neither succubi nor incubi are particularly violent, though they draw energy from the men and women to sustain themselves, often until the point of exhaustion or death of the victim.[1]</p>

        <div id="striga">
            <IMG SRC="img/striga.jpg" alt="striga" ALIGN="right" />
            <h4>Striga:</h4><p>A striga (Polish: strzyga) is a human woman transformed into a monster by a curse. She is filled with hatred towards all living beings, devouring them without a second thought. She only comes out on a full moon to hunt, fighting with incredible speed and strength.
            King Foltest would sometimes tie criminals up to stakes in the ground, who would serve as a meal for the beast.</p>

            <h4>Ekimma:</h4><p>"Bah, ain't nothing to fear. Ekimmaras, why, they ain't nothing more than overgrown bats.
            --Anonymous city guardsman's last words    
            Like other vampires. ekimmaras are not, despite what village gossips might say, undead humans. They are instead post-Conjunction monsters who have no particular feelings about garlic, holy water or religious symbols.
